# Wild West Forum

An intentionally insecure web application designed as a 
simple public forum for educational purposes. Users can 
register accounts, login, and make comments on the forum.


## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Public forum for posting comments


## Architecture

Browser → nginx (port 80) → Node.js Express Backend (port 3000, internal)

- nginx: Serves static files and acts as reverse proxy
- Node.js/Express: Handles API endpoints, authentication, and database operations
- Docker Compose: Orchestrates both containers with internal networking
